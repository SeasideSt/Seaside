"
The event-source element represents a target for events generated by a remote server.

The src attribute, if specified, must give a URI (or IRI) pointing to a resource that uses the application/x-dom-event-stream format.

When the element is inserted into the document, if it has the src attribute specified, the user agent must act as if the addEventSource() method on the event-source element had been invoked with the URI resulting from resolving the src attribute's value to an absolute URI.

While the element is in a document, if its src attribute is mutated, the user agent must act as if first the removeEventSource() method on the event-source element had been invoked with the URI resulting from resolving the old value of the attribute to an absolute URI, and then as if the addEventSource() method on the element had been invoked with the URI resulting from resolving the new value of the src attribute to an absolute URI.

When the element is removed from the document, if it has the src attribute specified, or, when the src attribute is about to be removed, the user agent must act as if the removeEventSource() method on the event-source element had been invoked with the URI resulting from resolving the src attribute's value to an absolute URI.

There can be more than one event-source element per document, but authors should take care to avoid opening multiple connections to the same server as HTTP recommends a limit to the number of simultaneous connections that a user agent can open per server.

The src DOM attribute must reflect the content attribute of the same name.
