[#668 state:resolved] (orv, kangax, Andrew Dupont, Tobie Langel) * Simplify String#(un)escapeHTML and remove their DOM dependencies. (Tobie Langel) * Update UnittestJS. Modifiy test template accordingly. (Tobie Langel) * Remove redundant if statement in Element#readAttribute. (Tobie Langel) * Add missing semicolons. [#751 state:resolved] (Diego Perini) * Remove expensive (for such low-level method) internal `getClass` in favor of plain string comparison (kangax) * Fix `PeriodicalExecuter` so that it no longer suppresses exceptions. [#696 state:resolved] (Samuel Lebeau, Yaffle) * Fix issue related to escaping of selectors for querySelectorAll. [#559 state:resolved] (Jorn Holm) *1.6.1_rc3* (June 16, 2009) * Fixed a variety of non-ASCII chars and similar [#610 state:resolved] (T.J. Crowder) * Add Chrome 1+ to the list of supported browsers. (kangax) * Fix `Template#evaluate` "eating" previous character if `null` was returned from `toTemplateReplacements` function. (Nir, Jürgen Hörmann, kangax) * Make sure (deficient) APPLET, OBJECT and EMBED elements are extended with simulated methods in IE8. Return early if `_extendedByPrototype` is present on an element. (Tobie Langel, kangax) * Replace array creation and `Array#include` with a more efficient `RegExp#test`. (kangax) * Reorganize the way `ElementExtensions` are defined. Make sure elements used in SpecificElementExtensions are cleaned up. (kangax) * Make sure $A works with primitive values. (mr_justin, kangax) * Do not browser sniff when forking `unmark` function in selector suite. Instead use a proper test - PROPERTIES_ATTRIBUTES_MAP. (kangax) * Do not use short-hand element methods notation (@element.getStyle() -> Element.getStyle(@element)) for performance reasons. Do not use `$A` and `Array.prototype.shift` when `Array.prototype.slice` can be used instead. (kangax) * `Prototype.Browser.Opera` now uses stronger inference and is determined by [[Class]] of `window.opera` being - "Opera". (kangax) * Fix error in event.js which prevented attaching more than one responder for an event name/element combination. [#651 state:resolved] (Rob Lineweaver) * Do not sniff when testing for IE''s proprietary mouseenter/mouseleave events support. Use more robust inference instead. (kangax) * Use `Prototype.emptyFunction` consistently throughout unit tests. [#253 state:resolved] (Michael M Slusarz, John David Dalton, kangax) * deprecation extension: mark Array#reduce() as removed. [#569 state:resolved] (Tobie Langel) * `Form.serialize` now works safely with forms that have "length"-named elements. [#77 state:resolved] (Peter Adrianov, John-David Dalton, kangax) *1.6.1_rc1* (March 22, 2009) * `Element#update` now takes care of SCRIPT elements in IE. [#573 state:resolved] (Martin, Tobie Langel, kangax) * Remove unused local variables from `Element.extend`. Fix one of the form tests to remove `_extendedByPrototype` by setting it to `undefined` rather than `false` (`_extendedByPrototype` being `false` does not force `Element.extend` to re-extend element). (T.J. Crowder, kangax) * Make test for `escapeHTML`/`unescapeHTML` more strict. (Chrome 1.x escapes "<" and "&" with `innerHTML`, but not ">") (kangax) * Remove another sniffing from one of DOM tests. Fixes last IE8 failure. (kangax) * `Element.extend` now takes care of IE8 bug when HTMLAppletElement and HTMLObjectElement objects do not inherit from `Element.prototype`. (kangax) * Fix DOM tests to use proper feature test when testing `setOpacity` (kangax) * Fix another failure in IE8, `for`/`htmlFor` {get/set}Attribute translation. (kangax) * Fix `Element#writeAttribute` and `Element#readAttribute` failures in IE8 due to lack of proper feature testing. (kangax) * Remove sniffing from one of the DOM tests, which produced failures in IE8. (kangax) * Fix `Form.reset` test where `respondsTo` wouldn''t detect a method due to typeof returning "object" (rather than "function") in IE (kangax) * Remove Array#reduce which currently overrides native `reduce` in clients implementing JS1.8, e.g. Firefox 3+ (Tobie Langel, Andrew Dupont, kangax) * Make sure try/catch/finally is used instead of try/finally for clients without support for the latter one (e.g. Blackberry, IE) (Ville Koskinen, kangax) * Use `in` operator when accessing property of a nodelist to prevent Safari <=2.0.4 from crashing (kangax) * Add Element#clone as a safe wrapper of native `cloneNode`. (Andrew Dupont, kangax) * Add tests to ensure IE8 properly assigns a class name in the `Element` constructor. [#529 state:resolved] (Riki Fridrich, Andrew Dupont) * Remove sniffing from `Element` when detecting broken `setAttribute` in IE. [#571 state:resolved] (kangax) * Remove sniffing from `Element.update` branching in favor of feature detection. [#574 state:resolved] (kangax) * Remove sniffing when branching `escapeHTML` and `unescapeHTML`. [#570 state:resolved] (kangax) * Redefine Element#down in IE 6-7 to avoid extending all descendants when no selector is given. [#452 state:resolved] (eno, Andrew Dupont) * Reverse the definitions of Event#pointer(X|Y) and Event#pointer to prevent unnecessary computation. [#403 state:resolved] (Nick Stakenburg, Andrew Dupont) * Add first-class support for `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events in non-IE browsers (IE supports them natively). [#350 state:resolved] (Nick Stakenburg, Andrew Dupont) * Make sure `_extendedByPrototype`, `_countedByPrototype`, and `prototypeUID` node expandos are accessed with `typeof` to prevent errors in some environments. [#354 state:resolved] (Hilberty, kangax, Andrew Dupont) * Fix issue where Opera 9.x returns incorrect results on certain Selector queries with descendant combinators. [#395 state:resolved] (Arpan, fearphage, kangax, Andrew Dupont) * Null out references to elements in cache on page unload. Need this in addition to the Event#stopObserving calls to clean up memory leaks. [#425 state:resolved] (ykphuah, mr_justin, Andrew Dupont) * Ensure `toString` and `valueOf` properties are copied to a subclass only when necessary in IE6. [#382 state:resolved] (Samuel Lebeau) * Make sure `getAttribute` is used without flag when accessing the "type" attribute of an iframe (IE throws error otherwise). [#118 state:resolved] (Zekid, kangax) * String#gsub should escape RegExp metacharacters when the first argument is a string. [#469 state:resolved] (michael, kangax) * Fix order of replacement in String#unescapeHTML [#544 state:resolved] (SWeini, kangax) * Fix issue where a Selector query rooted on a node that had not been attached to the document failed in IE. [#464 state:resolved] (jddalton, kangax, Douglas Fraser, Andrew Dupont) * Fix Selector to match elements with attributes containing hyphens. [#285 state:resolved] (leiyou, jddalton, kangax) * Make sure Form.reset always returns a reference to the receiver element. [#309 state:resolved] (Phil, kangax) * Escape ":" and "." characters when doing contextual CSS selection in browsers that support querySelectorAll. [#559 state:resolved] (fxtentacle, Andrew Dupont) * Ensure the `target` property on events is never undefined in IE. [#383 state:resolved] (Mathias Karstädt, Diego Perini, Andrew Dupont) * Ensure Element#descendants always returns an array. [#373 state:resolved] (kangax) * Don''t switch fixed position elements to absolute in Element.getDimensions [#543 state:resolved] (James Wheare) * Avoid infinite loops when calling String#sub with empty pattern [#534 state:resolved] (Samuel Lebeau) * Switch to Sprockets for building the Prototype distfiles. (sam) * Switch Object.is(Array|String|Number) to use the vastly-superior approach discovered by Juriy. (kangax) * Further fix to ensure Object.is(String|Number) do not throw exceptions on host objects in IE. (grepmaster, kangax, Tobie Langel, Andrew Dupont) * Ensure Enumerable#grep can handle strings with RegExp metacharacters. (Marton Kiss-Albert, kangax) * Switch to the "doScroll approach" for the dom:loaded custom event. (javier, Diego Perini, Nick Stakenburg, Andrew Dupont) * Optimize document.viewport.get(Dimensions|Width|Height). (Nick Stakenburg, Andrew Dupont) * Fix issue where Object#isString and Object#isNumber return false for String and Number "wrapper" objects. (atrepp, Samuel Lebeau, Andrew Dupont) * Set document.loaded = true before firing dom:loaded custom event. (Andrew Dupont) * Allow Element#store to accept an object containing several key/value pairs. (ZenCocoon, Andrew Dupont) * Change Element#store to return the element itself (for chaining). (Andrew Dupont) * Add non-bubbling custom events. A new final argument to Element#fire defaults to `true`; pass `false` to prevent bubbling when firing a custom event. (Andrew Dupont) * Alter event system to use new element storage API rather than have its own global hashtable. (Andrew Dupont) * Add Element#store and Element#retrieve for safe, hash-backed storage of element metadata (no memory leaks). Also add Element#getStorage for working with the element''s storage hash directly. Hat tip: Mootools. (ZenCocoon, Andrew Dupont) * Fix issue where certain versions of Safari treat class names case-insensitively in Selector/$$ queries. (Andrew Dupont, kangax, Brice) * Fix issue where Function#argumentNames returned incorrect results in IE when comments were intermixed with argument names. (Christophe Porteneuve, T.J. Crowder) * Selector.patterns should be represented as an ordered structure. (ADO, kangax) * Performance improvements in Function methods (Samuel Lebeau, kangax, jddalton, Tobie Langel).' id '90de383d-039a-41ef-9e4b-26b4ed9d9901' date '2 January 2010' time '4:34:52 pm' author 'lr' ancestors ((name 'Prototype-Core-jf.14' message 'correct #numArgs sender to #argumentCount' id '8806cb08-58db-4a45-9e26-e3d173e57b05' date '31 December 2009' time '11:24:47 am' author 'jf' ancestors ((name 'Prototype-Core-lr.13' message '- do not use any longer #printOn: and #printContentOn: in JSObject, but use #javascriptOn: and #javascriptContentOn:- implementors of external libraries that implment or send any of these methods need to perform the renaming as well' id '4cb27d68-357a-4ed7-8d71-ca727b73780b' date '24 December 2009' time '11:30:07 am' author 'lr' ancestors ((name 'Prototype-Core-jf.12' message 'Rename Seaside-Platform to Grease in order to help make clear that it is not Seaside-specific and can be used by other projects as a compatibility layer.
