The caused weirdness when unregistering a session - the render phase would then cause the session to re-register itself under a new key.To fix this, WAApplication now registers the session when it is created and the session should not re-register itself.Added #keyFor:ifAbsent: and #urlFor:ifAbsent: as well as #keyFor: and #urlFor: which signal a WAUnregisteredHandlerError if the handler is not found. Change senders of #urlForRequestHandler:addHandlerField: and #ensureKeyForHandler: to use these new methods. The RenderLoopContinuations now catch this error and redirect to a new session. If you want to redirect somewhere else, you should call WARequestContext>>redirectTo: after unregistering the session.Also rename several methods on WARegistry to get a more consistent interface, both internally and with WADispatcher) and deprecate the old versions (plus changed senders).' id 'ee93af56-d1fa-954d-bb87-1cdbe7fdb3d0' date '10/27/2008' time '17:46:04' author 'jf' ancestors ((name 'Seaside-Session-lr.38' message '- updating package information' id 'd2e8081b-c365-447b-b1f1-52733e8fef98' date '10/23/2008' time '22:08:35' author 'lr' ancestors ((name 'Seaside-Session-jf.37' message 'Added my best guess at package dependency information (please fill in descriptions)' id '4c66d0c0-8d42-7d4a-a4a5-502fe3bc38f4' date '10/23/2008' time '12:40:15' author 'jf' ancestors ((name 'Seaside-Session-jf.36' message 'http://code.google.com/p/seaside/issues/detail?id=214Fix WARequestContextNotFound error when trying to terminate the session process.We don''t have access to the current request context when running this code so we can''t use WASession>>preferenceAt:' id 'f40ef9e1-3ea8-b14e-b6b5-6231d591a155' date '10/22/2008' time '21:55:26' author 'jf' ancestors ((name 'Seaside-Session-jf.35' message 'move WASession>>sessionCookie to private category' id '65382fa1-fd46-5e4d-8625-3852b94a931a' date '10/20/2008' time '00:27:52' author 'jf' ancestors ((name 'Seaside-Session-jf.34' message 'refactor process termination code out of WASession>>handleRequest:' id '0ac31f26-8de7-3149-9c59-02c385db103c' date '10/19/2008' time '15:44:41' author 'jf' ancestors ((name 'Seaside-Session-jf.33' message 'Everything called from WASession>>handleRequest: is now expecting to have the Request Context passed into it so we don''t need to define WACurrentRequestContext there.
