Seaside development on git follows the [Git Flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). In short, we have two main branches:
- [master](https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside/tree/master): the stable version of Seaside
- [develop](https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside/tree/develop): the trunk version where development on the next version is happening

Bugfixes are always done on a separate branch which is merged into both master and develop.
New features are always done on a separate branch which is merged into develop.
When a new release is ready, 

# Code
We recommend contributing to Seaside using [Github pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/): fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. Core Seaside developers can create a branch in the main Seaside repository but we prefer a pull request is made for inclusion in the main branch as well.

If you are contributing a bugfix, then please pull against the master branch.
If you are contributing a new feature, then please pull against develop.

Dale Henrich's guide to [Getting started with Github](https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedWithGitHub.md) for Smalltalk development is a good read if you are new to using Github for Smalltalk projects. We are also working on some [[Practical Guidelines for Smalltalk development with Git]].

Please take the time to add comments and tests and provide a description of the change and the reason for the change in each commit message. Once you have submitted your pull request, an existing developer will then review the submission and either provide feedback or integrate the change. Sometimes we decide not to integrate a change. When this happens, there is usually a good reason; please ask if you arenâ€™t clear why your submission was not integrated.

We have fairly detailed [coding conventions](Coding-Conventions) to help maintain portability. Please read through them to make the job of porting Seaside to other Smalltalk dialects not unnecessarily complex and to maintain a consistent coding style.

We have set-up automated [Travis-CI tests](https://travis-ci.org/SeasideSt/Seaside), which will be automatically executed when you submit the pull request. You can run them in your own fork before submitting the pull request, and you can even run them locally. See the [Smalltalk-CI](https://github.com/hpi-swa/smalltalkCI) project for all details.

All Seaside code is licensed under the MIT License and, by submitting code to the project, you are agreeing to provide your code under this license. Before submitting, please also ensure that you have the legal rights to license the code you are submitting; in many areas, your employer may own the rights to code you create even in your spare time.

Seaside development discussions take place on the [Developer Mailing list](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/seaside-dev). Feel free to send us an email there.

Once you have submitted a few patches and are comfortable with our process and coding conventions feel free to ask to be added as a developer on Github SeasideSt team. Just create an account and ask on the [Developer Mailing list](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/seaside-dev), providing your username.

# Picking something to work on

If you have no itch to scratch you can pick an issue from the bug tracker that nobody has yet started on to work.

You can see if there are any bugs marked ["BiteSize"](https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside/labels/BiteSize). These issues have been marked by the core developers as being appropriate for someone with limited experience or available time and are a good place to get your feet wet. The issue should have a clearly-documented solution and should normally be doable with a few hours of work or less. Still, they may be harder than we thought so if you run into trouble, feel free to ask for help or clarification on the Developer Mailing List


# Checkout

The following way to check out the code has been working for me

1. checkout the Grease dev branch
1. checkout the Seaside develop branch

```st
"load Grease from the checkout"
Metacello new
	baseline: 'Grease';
	repository: 'filetree:///home/user/git/Grease/repository';
	fetch;
	load: 'Core Tests'.

"lock Grease to the checkout"
Metacello image
  project: 'Grease';
  lock.

"load Seaside from the checkout"
Metacello new
	baseline: 'Seaside3';
	repository: 'filetree:///home/user/git/Seaside/repository';
	fetch;
	load: 'CI'.
```
